## 🛠️ Amazon EKS Tools

- [Amazon EKS MCP Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-mcp-getting-started.html) - This guide walks you through the steps to setup and use the EKS MCP Server with your AI code assistants. You’ll learn how to configure your environment, connect to the server, and start managing your EKS clusters through natural language interactions.

- [EKS Node Viewer](https://github.com/awslabs/eks-node-viewer) - A tool for visualizing dynamic node usage within a cluster. It was originally developed as an internal tool at AWS for demonstrating consolidation with Karpenter. It displays the scheduled pod resource requests vs the allocatable capacity on the node. It does not look at the actual pod resource usage.
